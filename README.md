# Smart-IoT-Based-Electric-Vehicle-Diagnostic-Tool
Smart IoT-Based Electric Vehicle Diagnostic Tool monitors EV parameters like battery voltage, current, speed, throttle, brake status, and temperature in real time. Using Arduino Mega and ESP8266, data is sent to the ThingSpeak cloud for remote monitoring, fault detection, and improved EV reliability.
